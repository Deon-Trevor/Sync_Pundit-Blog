Thousands of people have written blogs, tweets and made videos about it, here's another one!</p><p></p><h2>Bulletproof Hosts</h2><p>Hosting, as we know it, is what powers the internet. A hosting provider is a company that leases some computing power to costumers to use - usually for serving websites like this awesome blog 游땚. This leased computing power is not limited to awesome blogs. They host mail servers, dns servers, databases, web apps, malware and phishing sites....</p><p>That is where bulletproof hosts come in. Most hosting providers have strict policies in that govern what can be hosted on their servers, bulletproof hosts do not. They choose to turn a blind eye to whatever is hosted on their servers and typically do not have much, if any, policies on what can and cannot be hosted on their servers. Naturally they are popular with cyber criminals. They host malware, botnet command and control centers, black market websites, phishing websites, etc.</p><p>On a high level, a bulletproof host has these properties:</p><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Loose policies</li><li>Evade responsibility</li><li>Difficult to impossible report procedure</li><li>Slow to no response to reports</li></ul><h2></h2><h2>Namecheap's Kevlar</h2><p>Namecheap is both a registrar and hosting provider. A registrar is a company that registers domain names. Usually these companies also sell these domains, so much so that it's become "standard" that whomever you buy your domains from will register them as well. Since the registrar is in charge of the domain name, it naturally follows that the hosting provider will hold more weight in having phishing sites taken down - since they are the ones hosting the actual phishing content.</p><p>This is Namecheap's first line of defense to evade responsibility. <span style="color: #3598db;"><a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #3598db;">ICANN clearly states that</a></span>:</p><p><strong><em>3.18.1 Registrar shall maintain an abuse contact to receive reports of abuse involving Registered Names sponsored by Registrar, including reports of Illegal Activity. Registrar shall publish an email address to receive such reports on the home page of Registrar's website (or in another standardized place that may be designated by<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>맍rom time to time). Registrar shall take reasonable and prompt steps to investigate and respond appropriately to any reports of abuse.</em></strong></p><p><span style="color: #3598db;"><a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-2012-02-25-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #3598db;">ICANN</a><span style="color: #000000;">is a not-for-profit partnership of people from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and inter-operable.</span></span></p><p><strong><em>To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer - a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other.<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>맊oordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without that coordination we wouldn't have one global Internet.</em></strong></p><p>Back to Namecheap. The guys that govern THE INTERNET state that a registrar should deal with phishing and malware associated with domains they registered but Namecheap thinks different. Their policy states:</p><p></p><div><strong><em>Some types of abuse may not be verified from our side if we only act as a registrar and the abusive content resides on third-party servers. Due to this, we will not take restrictive action in order to avoid false-positive cases. This policy particularly affects copyright/DMCA, email abuse/spam, fraud, malware/hacking activity, etc.</em></strong></div><div></div><div><strong><em>To expedite the resolution, we highly recommended escalating websites that are registered with Namecheap only to their respective hosting provider supporting your report with sufficient evidence. You might also decide to get in touch with the domain name holder directly by using the Whois details that are assigned to that domain name. If the Whois details are hidden by our</em></strong><span style="color: #3598db;"><em style="font-size: 18.4px; font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold); font-family: var(--font-base);"><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/domain-privacy/" style="border-bottom: 3px solid rgba(var(--yellow), 1); color: #3598db;">Domain Privacy protection</a></em></span><strong style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;"><em>맙ervice, feel free to send your email to the<span style="color: #3598db;"><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/344/37/how-does-domain-privacy-work/" style="color: #3598db;">protected email address</a></span>. It will then be forwarded to the real email address of the domain holder.</em></strong></div><p></p><p>Basically they are saying as long as they're the registrar only, not providing the hosting service, they are not to be bothered with reports of phishing or malware or whatever else. They go on to say suggest that we talk to THE OWNER OF THE PHISHING DOMAIN and perhaps <span style="color: #3598db;"><a href="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/metamask-phishing-site/" style="color: #3598db;">ask them nicely to stop</a></span>.</p><p>This is Namecheap's ultimate defense.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/5/gaara.gif" alt="gaara's ultimate defense" width="711" height="534"></figure><p></p><p>With this shield they can hide away from taking responsibility for all sorts of nefarious actors using their services.먝</p><p></p><h2>What about Namecheap Hosting?</h2><p>NO!
