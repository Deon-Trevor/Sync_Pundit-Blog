Sharing educational pieces such as this blog post which look deeper into the details of how these scams operate is part of how we can combat this as an industry. The following section will look further into the technical details of the attack.</span></p><p> </p><h4>DNS Analysis</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the phishing scams that we see targeting cryptocurrency exchange users are set up in the following way. The scammers purchase a domain and website hosting, set up a phishing kit that they’ve either developed or purchased and mass deliver the attack to the victims, either through social media channels or email. Their DNS setup is normally fairly simple. The phishing domain’s registrar also provides the name servers, at best the website is hidden behind proxies like Cloudflare.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular scam setup on the domain Lcryptos [.] com had an interesting DNS setup.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//dns.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//responsive/dns-xs.png 300w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//responsive/dns-sm.png 480w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//responsive/dns-md.png 768w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//responsive/dns-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//responsive/dns-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7//responsive/dns-2xl.png 1600w" alt="lcryptos.com dns" width="512" height="189"></figure><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had set up mail exchange servers on chengmail[.]cn</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had set up SPF: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TXT lcryptos[.]com v=spf1 include:spf.chengmail.cn ~all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lcryptos[.]com’s WHOIS records show that it was registered on 1 July 2021.

Over the course of the next few days, the scammer tries to discover whether or not the victim has a sizable income/savings while subtly using the images and conversation to suggest that the fictional character they’re impersonating is living a lavish lifestyle. They send pictures of themselves eating fancy meals, shopping for expensive bags and pictures of their luxury villas and apartments.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/food.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/food-xs.png 300w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/food-sm.png 480w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/food-md.png 768w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/food-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/food-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/food-2xl.png 1600w" alt="fake restaurant pic " width="371" height="371"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/white-mention.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/white-mention-xs.png 300w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/white-mention-sm.png 480w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/white-mention-md.png 768w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/white-mention-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/white-mention-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/white-mention-2xl.png 1600w" alt="fake white mansion" width="438" height="512"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/mension-green.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/mension-green-xs.png 300w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/mension-green-sm.png 480w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/mension-green-md.png 768w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/mension-green-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/mension-green-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/mension-green-2xl.png 1600w" alt="fake mansion " width="412" height="512"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/bath.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/bath-xs.png 300w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/bath-sm.png 480w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/bath-md.png 768w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/bath-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/bath-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.syncpundit.ml/media/posts/7/responsive/bath-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Fake mansion bathroom" width="512" height="504"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next after winning over the trust of the victim, the scammer reveals the secret to how they make their money - they know someone who’s an expert in cryptocurrency trading.

They then give the victim good trading signals and help them turn some decent profits. They keep this going for a few days, encouraging the user to increase the money they’ve invested each day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the victims that are interested in crypto investing they would have them download Binance and take them through the same process, often helping them make some decent profits over the course of a few days. This process proves to be highly effective in getting the victims eager to start making “serious money”. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After gaining the victim’s trust, they encourage the victim to go all in. The story is that the expert forecasted that the following week the market will be bullish and it would be a great opportunity to make a fortune. They have the victim gather all their savings and have them ready for next week’s market. It’s at this point that they introduce “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an even better platform with lower rates</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” - LCryptos, the phishing website. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victim registers an account on LCryptos, deposits their savings into the scammers’ address, and before they even know it, the victim’s money is gone without them even noticing it. The platform shows fake graphs and terminals of the victim’s investment turning profits. When the victim tries to withdraw their profits they get a warning sent preventing them from withdrawing. These warnings vary but they follow a similar structure: the account has been flagged for some form of misconduct, usually money laundering, and the victim has to prove they are the rightful owners of the account by depositing at least 50% of the amount they are trying to withdraw.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One victim reported that they sent the required 50% but from a different account and was directed to deposit again, but from the same account they had used to make the initial deposit. They followed the instructions but like all the other victims, the platform’s support kept finding different reasons why the identity verification was failing and kept asking for more deposits to settle the account.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some victims caught on to the scam quickly and some, unfortunately, kept depositing more money until they had drained all their funds and some even took out loans. When the victims confronted the “Asian woman” she denies any foul play, and she goes on to show that her withdrawals went through and that the victims should just follow the instructions and everything should work out.</span></p><p> </p><h4>Detection</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I attempted to open lcryptos[.]com and its subdomains but they were not resolving, yet the victims were able to visit the site. This suggests that the website only resolves when the host has a specific referrer. This was later confirmed by one of the victims I found on Twitter. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obfuscation methods like these make it especially difficult to detect these kinds of attacks. Another reason for the difficulty in detecting these kinds of attacks is the embarrassment the victims face due to the nature of the circumstances that hinder them from coming forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been affected by this, or a similar scam please reach out to me and even if I can’t recover your funds I can move towards shutting down the scam and making sure that the public is aware of techniques that scammers are using, hopefully protecting themsevles in the future.</span></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Wednesday, 31 August 2022</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/sync/phishing/">Phishing</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/sync/research/">Research</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F&amp;via=Sync_Pundit&amp;text=Romance%20Scam%20Network" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F7%2FMetaTrader-last.png&amp;description=Romance%20Scam%20Network" class="js-share icon brands fa-pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F&amp;title=Romance%20Scam%20Network" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Romance%20Scam%20Network&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Romance%20Scam%20Network https%3A%2F%2Fblog.syncpundit.ml%2Fromance-scam-network%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/authors/sync_pundit/" class="invert" rel="author">Sync_Pundit</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>©  SYNC_PUNDIT</li><li><a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><em>/usr/bin/Sync_Pundit</em><a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a></li><li>Curious n00b</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://blog.syncpundit.ml/assets/js/main.min.js?v=149e72e3ae18744a477b480b19e0c6da"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
